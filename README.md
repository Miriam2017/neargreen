# About Us

NearGreen began as the musing of one person: "Where can I find healthy -- and affordable -- grocery stores in Philadelphia?" It began, too, with a single document, the city of Philadelphia's report on Walkable Corner Stores http://www.phila.gov/health/pdfs/Walkable%20Access%20to%20Healthy%20Food%202012-2014.pdf. It grew into an app designed to help everyone in the city see where they might find healthy food near them. We hope it will contribute to better health--and to ending the food deserts that still plague our city. 

We began with a five-member team-- and lots of help. By Code for Philly Demo Night in October 2016 we managed to pull something together. Amazingly, we even won the Jawn Audience Award. For non-Philadelphians, "jawn" means, well, everything; it's one of our local mystery words. We thank everyone at Demo Night for inspiring us. 

Then the real work began. One of our shareable lessons is that after Demo Night, it takes time to make a workable app. That "minimal demo-able product"? The road from there to "workable webapp" can be long. We've pulled in new team members, and as of Spring 2017, we're headed toward problem-solving, debugging, and making this webapp available. 

We hope that the NearGreen webapp will be useful to Philadelphians, and that the model will be replicable and scalable to other locales.
